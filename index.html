                    <p>Because if it hasn’t got caffeine in it, is it even a fat burner? Caffeine promotes fat burning
                        by increasing thermogenesis (calorie burning)1 and lipolysis (the breakdown of fat)2. It’s a
                        proven performance enhancer, so it’ll help you boss your workouts. And as a stimulant, it’ll
                        give you an instant dose of energy and alertness, making every day a “let’s do this!” day.

                    <p>A single 100mg dose of caffeine (around the same amount you’ll get in Trimtone) can increase
                        resting metabolic rate by up to 3-4%
                        <br>
                        Reviews of multiple trials and studies concluded that caffeine can promote weight, BMI and body
                        fat reduction and improves exercise performance by up to 11.2%

                    <h2>Green Coffee</h2>
                    <p>Green coffee beans are raw, unroasted coffee beans filled with lots of lovely things like
                        chlorogenic acid that would otherwise be burned away in the roasting process. Chlorogenic acid
                        is thought to reduce the amount of fat and glucose absorbed by your gut when you eat6, lowering
                        insulin levels and improving your metabolism. Being a source of caffeine (obvs), it’s also a
                        thermogenic, upping your daily calorie burn rate to maximise your weight loss.

                        your metabolism and levels of hormones that actually tell cells to break down fat9. Researchers
                        also reckon that catechins in green tea may reduce the amount of carbohydrates your body

                        adipose tissue(BAT). BAT keeps your body warm by burning calories – it’s basically made for
                        thermogenesis. When activated, it burns through fat like nobody’s business. Studies have also
                        shown that BAT activation can also help regulate blood sugar levels. This means your energy
                        levels will remain more stable throughout the day, so you’re less likely to experience food
                        cravings.

                    </h3>
                    <p class="faq1-p" id="faq1-p" style="display: block;">Yes! Trimtone contains ingredients like
                        caffeine, green tea extract and grains of paradise, all of which have loads of studies showing
                        their effectiveness in contributing to weight loss.

                    <h3>Do I have to diet and exercise?</h3>
                    <p class="faq2-p" id="faq2-p">Of course! Trimtone is not a miracle pill that’ll magically melt away
                        fat while you sit back and chill. Yes, it will help your body burn additional calories and boost
                        the fat burning process, which will help you lose weight. But nobody ever achieved their goals
                        without effort. So if you have no intention of eating healthy and getting active on the reg,
                        Trimtone – or any other weight loss supplement – is not for you.

                    <h3>How do I take Trimtone?
                    </h3>
                    <p class="faq3-p" id="faq3-p">We recommend you take one Trimtone capsule each morning with 8oz of
                        water 30mins before your breakfast. Most other fat burner supplements require you to take them
                        several times throughout the day. But who’s got time to remember that? We’ve made Trimtone super
                        easy for you to use so you can get on with your life and focus on what’s important.

                    <p class="faq4-p" id="faq4-p">Absolutely! Trimtone contains caffeine, the most famous stimulant and
                        thermogenic fat burner there is. Which makes it a great pre-workout, especially if you train in
                        the morning. If you train in the evening though, we don’t recommend you use it as a pre-workout.
                        Because, caffeine. </p>

                        of diet and exercise plan you’re following. Most of our customers who take Trimtone alongside a
                        healthy diet and regular exercise see noticeable results within a few weeks.
